# Machine-Learning-Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects implemented in Python. Below are the details for each main file and its purpose:

## Cifar10_Data_Prediction_CNN.ipynb
- Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset (10 classes of 32x32 color images).
- Steps include loading and normalizing data, building and training a CNN, evaluating accuracy, and visualizing predictions.
- Technologies: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib.

## Fraud_detection_analysis.ipynb
- Analyzes a financial transaction dataset to detect fraud using machine learning (XGBoost).
- Steps include data exploration, feature engineering, handling missing values, cleaning, modeling, and evaluation.
- Technologies: Python, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas.

## melbourn_House_price_detector.ipynb
- Predicts Melbourne house prices using regression techniques.
- Steps include loading and cleaning data, feature scaling, training a regression model, and evaluating performance.
- Technologies: Python, scikit-learn, pandas.
